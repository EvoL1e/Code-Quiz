# Code Quiz

## Description

I was tasked with making a coding quiz that would ask someone some questions and then the user would be prompted to answer them. With each incorrect answer it would penalize the player by reducing the time they have. The scores must be kept track and if the user beats their score it prompts them to add their initials.

## Installation

* If you wish to install this for future development you can follow these steps
    1. Fork the repository from Github (The link to the github is: 
        https://github.com/EvoL1e/Coding-Quiz)
    2. Clone the repository by going to the green code button
    3. Open up GitBash (Windows) or Terminal (MacOs) and write down git clone (SSH key link from the green code button)
    4. Once cloned go to wherever your cloned files are set up
    5. Open the file with your IDE of choice and start coding or if you want to try it within your local system ensure that you have node installed (you can do this by typing in the console node --v), move to the develop folder, install the required files by doing npm i, and then doing node index.js

## Usage

To use the quiz just hit the "start game" button. Afterwards it'll ask you some questions and all you have to do is answer them by clicking one of the buttons with the answer. If you get it wrong you'll see the timer go down quicker. It'll keep track of your score the entire time while doing so.
